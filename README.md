Face Detection using OpenCV
===============================

ABOUT THE PROGRAM
---------------------
This Python program performs face detection using OpenCV. It allows users to choose between:

1. Detecting faces from a static image (default or custom path)
2. Detecting faces in real-time using the webcam

You can also select one of the following face detection methods:
- DNN-SSD (Deep Neural Network using a pre-trained Caffe model) 
- Haar Cascade 
- LBP Cascade 

Detected faces are displayed with bounding boxes. DNN method additionally shows the confidence scores.

WARNINGS
---------

Make sure to handle privacy permissions for custom path directories as well as webcam access for Pycharm or any other IDE especially for Mac for the code to run seamlessly.
